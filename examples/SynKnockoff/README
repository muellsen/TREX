Scripts to generate and test Lasso and TREX within the knockoff filtering framework

Linear models (n>p setting) with both uncorrelated/correlated homescedastic as well as heteroscedastic noise has been used to validated 
the framework and compared to Lasso-based knockoff filtering

Short description of the scripts 
testExampleTraceFDP.m	Simple demo how to use TREX and Lasso with knockoff filtering (similar to examples in Barber and Candes) 
across multiple target FDRs

testKnockoffSynthetic.m	Advanced demo how to use TREX and Lasso with knockoff filtering (similar to examples in Barber and Candes) 
with fixed FDR

testTREXSynKnockoffCorr.m	Script to test Lasso/TREX knockoff filtering with correlated noise 
testTREXSynKnockoffHS.m Script to test Lasso/TREX knockoff filtering with heteroscedastic noise

The results for the latter two tests are found in Figure 7, Bien et al, 2017
